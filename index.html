                    <p>DH Bridge workshops aim to help build computational thinking and digital skills within the context of the humanities.</p> 

                    <p>Building on the model of <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a>, these workshops seek to support a diverse coding community within the digital humanities with a curriculum tailored to the needs and questions of humanities scholars.</p>

                    <h2>Why DH Bridge?</h2>

                    <p>Technical skill and the ability to think computationally drives some of the most innovative work in the digital humanities. As women working in the field, we see first-hand the lack of diversity among those working with code and are concerned by the persistent divide between those creating and those using digital tools. Building on current conversations about the cultural and structural obstacles that make it difficult for underrepresented groups to learn to code, we are creating a workshop curriculum that encourages a diverse coding community in the digital humanities.</p>

                    <h2>Who are We?</h2>
                       <h3>Celeste Sharpe</h3>
                        <p>I’m Celeste Tường Vy Sharpe, a phd candidate in history and art history at George Mason University exploring the realm of digital humanities. I work at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media on a number of projects.</p>
                        <p>My main research interests are visual culture and the construction of social identities. My dissertation is tentatively titled “They Need You!: Disability, Visual Culture, and the Poster Child, 1945-1980,” and looks at how charitable organizations, disabled children and their families, and the public understood and shaped ideas about disability, identity, philanthropy, family, and the nation after WWII. I’m focusing on representations and understandings of physical disability for this project, and so am examining depictions of polio and muscular dystrophy.</p>

                        <h3>Jeri Wieringa</h3>
                        <p>I am a phd candidate in history at George Mason University and a graduate research assistant at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media.</p>

                        <p>I research at the intersection of digital and religious history, exploring cultural formation and interrogating how digital technology changes the range of possibilities for historical analysis. My dissertation, "A Gospel of Health and Salvation," is focused on the relationships between health reform, Seventh-day Adventism, and domestic reform in the 19th century.</p>
