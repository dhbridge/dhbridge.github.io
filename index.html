                    <p>DH Bridge workshops aim to build computational thinking and digital skills within the context of the humanities.</p> 

                    <p>Building on the model of <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a>, these one-day workshops seek to support a diverse coding community within the digital humanities with a curriculum tailored to the needs and questions of humanities scholars.</p>

                    <h2>Why DH Bridge?</h2>

                    <p>Despite the expansion of the digital humanities over the last few years, there remains a persistent divide between those who engage directly with code and those who work with the tools others create. While the number of training opportunities has increased to address this gap, especially in the form of courses connected to graduate programs and training institutes focused on a wide range of digital skills, these formats often place a significant burden on the individual scholar, especially in terms of time or money and often both.</p>

                    <p>In addition, such formats do not necessarily address the problems of "<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260102800090">stereotype threat</a>" for women, people of color, and queer/LGBT persons who desire to join the community of coders. We believe it is necessary to create environments where those from underrepresented groups feel comfortable engaging with the conversations, where the fear of failure and the fear of being treated differently is openly acknowledged and intentionally minimized.</p>

                    <p>In response to these concerns, and building on current conversations about the cultural and structural obstacles that make it difficult for persons from underrepresented groups to learn to code, we are creating a workshop curriculum that encourages a diverse coding community in the digital humanities.</p>

                       <h3>Celeste Sharpe</h3>
                        <p>I’m Celeste Tường Vy Sharpe, a phd candidate in history and art history at George Mason University exploring the realm of digital humanities. I work at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media on a number of projects.</p>
                        <p>My main research interests are visual culture and the construction of social identities. My dissertation is tentatively titled “They Need You!: Disability, Visual Culture, and the Poster Child, 1945-1980,” and looks at how charitable organizations, disabled children and their families, and the public understood and shaped ideas about disability, identity, philanthropy, family, and the nation after WWII. I’m focusing on representations and understandings of physical disability for this project, and so am examining depictions of polio and muscular dystrophy.</p>

                        <h3>Jeri Wieringa</h3>
                        <p>I am a PhD candidate in history at George Mason University and a graduate research assistant at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media.</p>

                        <p>I research at the intersection of digital and religious history, exploring cultural formation and interrogating how digital technology changes the range of possibilities for historical analysis. For my dissertation, "A Gospel of Health and Salvation," I am using computational methods and digital modes of presentations to analyze the relationships between health reform, Seventh-day Adventism, and domestic reform in the United States in the 19th century.</p>
